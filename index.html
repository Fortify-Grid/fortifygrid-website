            <div class="content-box">
                <p class="lead-text">U.S. electricity demand is skyrocketing, driven by AI data centers, reshored manufacturing, and the electrification of sectors such as transportation and HVAC. Meanwhile, renewables like solar and wind are replacing fossil-fuel-based baseload power, driven as much by commercial forces as the desire for decarbonization.</p>
                <p>But there is a problem. The intermittency of renewables, compounded by extreme weather, is driving both higher demand and more unpredictability.</p>
                <p>Add to this an aging, underfunded and strained grid, and we have the perfect storm: chronic supply uncertainty combined with unprecedented volatility in wholesale prices.</p>
                <p class="highlight">This is an increasing concern for electricity grids world-wide.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <p class="lead-text">Batteries are fast-responding assets that can act as both load and supply as needed, making them an indispensable asset class for aging grids as they manage increasing demand and supply volatility.</p>
                <p>The U.S. market for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) has seen explosive growth, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) exceeding 70% over the last five years. BESS has matured to attract tens of billions in investment, yet the sector remains in its early stages.</p>
                <p>Despite the current capacity of &lt;35GW, the market is projected to exceed 250GW in the next decade, with global storage capacity expected to surpass 2,000GW over 25 years.</p>
                <p class="highlight">Fundamental shifts in storage technology and deployment are anticipated during this period. FortifyGrid is well-positioned to become a leader in this space, with a focus on innovation, technical expertise, and modular, distributed assets.</p>
